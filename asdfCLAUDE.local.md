Read through:
- plan.md
- implementation.md

We have spent a significant amount of time debugging issues and the implementation we had is different than we originally intended in those files. For example, We now have streaming_slammer.py, which is an abstract way of interacting with Slam3r. We have created a bunch of test files in the test folder in the parent directory as well as in the slammer directory. 

Carefully review the slam3r project, and the mesh_service project.
