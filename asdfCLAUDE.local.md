- plan.md

We have spent a significant amount of time debugging issues and the implementation we had is different than we originally intended in those files. For example, We now have streaming_slammer.py, which is an abstract way of interacting with Slam3r. We have created a bunch of test files in the test folder in the parent directory as well as in the slammer directory. 

Carefully review the slam3r project, and the mesh_service project. 

We are now going through the mesh_service project to remove all todos and placeholders.

<OUTPUT>
All things that should be implemented in the final version of the mesh_service project should be implemented. Therefore, come up with a to-do list and plan how to implement all these features for me to approve.
